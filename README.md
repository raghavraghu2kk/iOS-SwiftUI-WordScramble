# iOS-SwiftUI-WordScramble
This project will be another game, although really it’s just a sneaky way for me to introduce more Swift and SwiftUI knowledge! The game will show players a random eight-letter word, and ask them to make words out of it. For example, if the starter word is “alarming” they might spell “alarm”, “ring”, “main”, and so on.
